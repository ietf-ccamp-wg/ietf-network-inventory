<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>Network hardware inventory management is a key component in operators' OSS architectures.</t>

<t>Network inventory is a fundamental functionality in network management
  and was specified many years ago. Given the emerging of data models and 
  their deployment in operator's management and control systems, the traditional function of inventory management
  is also requested to be defined as a data model.</t>

<t>Network inventory management and monitoring is a critical part of 
  ensuring the network stays healthy, well-planned, and functioning 
  in the operator's network. Network inventory management allows the
  operator to keep track of what physical network devices are staying
  in the network including relevant software and hardware.</t>

<t>The network inventory management also helps the operator to know when 
  to acquire new assets and what is needed, or to decommission old or faulty ones, 
  which can help to improve network performance and capacity planning.</t>

<t>In <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability"/> a gap was identified regarding the lack of a YANG data model that could be used at ACTN MPI interface level to report whole/partial hardware inventory information available at PNC level towards north-bound systems (e.g., MDSC or OSS layer).</t>

<t><xref target="RFC8345"/> initial goal was to make possible the augmentation of the YANG data model with network inventory data model but this was never developed and the scope was kept limited to network topology data only.</t>

<t>It is key for operators to drive the industry towards the use of a standard YANG data model for network inventory data instead of using vendors proprietary APIs (e.g., REST API).</t>

<t>In the ACTN architecture, this would bring also clear benefits at MDSC level for packet over optical integration scenarios since this would enable the correlation of the inventory information with the links information reported in the network topology model.</t>

<t>The intention is to define a generic YANG data model that would be as much as possible technology agnostic (valid for IP, optical and microwave networks) and that could be augmented, when required, to include some technology-specific inventory details.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC8348"/> defines a YANG data model for the management of the hardware on a single server and therefore it is more applicable to the PNC South Bound Interface (SBI) towards the network elements rather than at the PNC MPI. However, the YANG data model defined in <xref target="RFC8348"/> has been used as a reference for defining the YANG network hardware inventory data model.</t>

<t>For optical network hardware inventory, the network inventory YANG data model should support the use cases (4a and 4b) and requirements defined in <xref target="ONF_TR-547"/>, in order to guarantee a seamless integration at MDSC/OSS/orchestration layers.</t>

<t>The proposed YANG data model has been analyzed to cover the requirements and use cases for Optical Network Hardware Inventory.</t>

<t>Being based on <xref target="RFC8348"/>, this data model should be a good starting point toward a generic data model and applicable to any technology. However, further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to extend the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of networks (IP and microwave) and to identify which aspects are generic and which aspects are technology-specific for optical networks.</t>

<t>This document defines one YANG module: ietf-network-inventory.yang (<xref target="ni-yang"/>).</t>

<t>Note: review in future versions of this document the related modules, depending on the augmentation relationship.</t>

<t>The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>

<t>Based on TMF classification in <xref target="TMF-MTOSI"/>, inventory objects can be divided into two groups, holder group and equipment group. The holder group contains rack, chassis, slot, sub-slot while the equipment group contains network-element, board and port. With the requirement of GIS and on-demand domain controller selection raised, the equipment room becomes a new inventory object to be managed besides TMF classification.</t>

<t>Logically,  the relationship between these inventory objects can be described by <xref target="fig-inventory-object-relationship"/> below:</t>

<t>In <xref target="RFC8348"/>, rack, chassis, slot, sub-slot, board and port are defined as components of network elements with generic attributes.</t>

<t>Considering there are some special scenarios, the relationship between the rack and network elements is not 1 to 1 nor 1 to n. The network element cannot be the direct parent node of the rack. So there should be n to m relationship between racks and network elements.
And the chassis in the rack should have some reference information to the component.</t>

<t>While <xref target="RFC8348"/> is used to manage the hardware of a single server (e.g., a Network Element), the Network Inventory YANG data model is used to retrieve the network hardware inventory information that a controller discovers from multiple Network Elements under its control.</t>

<t>However, the YANG data model defined in <xref target="RFC8348"/> has been used as a reference for defining the YANG network inventory data model. This approach can simplify the implementation of this network hardware inventory model when the controller uses the YANG data model defined in <xref target="RFC8348"/> to retrieve the hardware  from the network elements under its control.</t>

<t>Note: review in future versions of this document which attributes from <xref target="RFC8348"/> are required also for network hardware inventory and whether there are attributes not defined in <xref target="RFC8348"/> which are required for network hardware inventory</t>

<t>Note: review in future versions of this document whether to re-use definitions from <xref target="RFC8348"/> or use schema-mount.</t>

<section anchor="common-design-for-all-inventory-objects"><name>Common Design for All Inventory Objects</name>

<t>For all the inventory objects, there are some common attributes existing. Such as:</t>

<t>Identifier: here we suggest to use uuid format which is widely used by development of systems. It could be globally unique easily.</t>

<t>Name: name is a human-readable label information which could be used to present on GUI. This name is suggested to be provided by server.</t>

<t>Alias: alias is also a human-readable label information which could be modified by user. It could also be present on GUI instead of name.</t>

<t>Description: description is a human-readable information which could be also input by user. Description provides more detailed information to prompt users when maintaining.</t>

<t>Location: location is a common management requirement of operators. This location could be absolute position, e.g. address, or relative position, e.g. port index. Different types of inventory objects require different types of position.</t>

<section anchor="new-parent-identifiers-reference"><name>New Parent Identifiers' Reference</name>

<t><xref target="RFC8348"/> provided an "parent-ref" attribute, which was an identifier reference to its parent component. When the MDSC or OSS systems want to find this component's grandparent or higher hierarchal level component, they need to retrieve this parent-ref step by step. To reduce this duplicated work, we tend to provide a list of hierarchical parent components' identifier reference.</t>

<section anchor="efficiency-issue"><name>Efficiency Issue</name>

<t>During doing the design of integration with OSS, some efficiency issues have been discovered.  More discussion is needed to be done in the future to address this issue.</t>

<t>Considering relational database is widely used by traditional OSS systems and part of PNCs, the inventory objects are probably saved in different tables. If the generic model is adopted, when doing a full synchronization, PNC needs to convert all inventory objects of each NE into component objects and combine them together into a single list, and then construct a response and send to OSS or MDSC. The OSS or MDSC needs to classify the component list and divide them into different groups, in order to save them in different tables. The combining-regrouping steps are impacting the PNC &amp; OSS/MDSC processing, which may result in efficiency issue in large scale networks.</t>

<t>We also designed a YANG model which defines the inventory objects directly instead of defining with generic components. There still could be some scalability issues when synchronizing full inventory resource in large scale of networks. This scalability issue is caused by the small transmission capability of HTTP protocol. We think that this scalability should be solved on protocol level instead of some specific data model.</t>

<t>In case there are some other special types of inventory objects could be used in other technologies and have not been recognized by us, we would like to provide a generic model. If we define the inventory objects directly and give them fix hierarchical relationships in YANG model, once there is a new type of inventory object needs to be introduced into the model, we need to break down our YANG model and insert the new one, this is incompatible change which is unacceptable by the developer to implement. In comparison, we only need to augment a new component class and extend some specific attributes for this new inventory if we adopt generic model, which is more acceptable. We think this compatible issue is prior to the efficiency issue mentioned above, therefore, we continue to work on generic component model.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="some-other-considerations"><name>Some Other Considerations</name>

<t>Note: review in future versions of this document whether the component list should be under the network-inventory instead of under the network-element container</t>

<t>Note that in <xref target="RFC8345"/>, topology and inventory are two subsets of network information. However, considering the complexity of the existing topology models and to have a better extension capability, we define a separate root for the inventory model. We will consider some other ways to do some associations between the topology model and inventory model in the future.</t>

<t>Note: review in future versions of this document whether network hardware inventory should be defined as an augmentation of the network model defined in <xref target="RFC8345"/> instead of under a new network-inventory root.</t>

<t>The proposed YANG data model has been analyzed to cover the requirements and use cases for Optical Network Inventory.</t>

<t>Further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to extend the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of networks (IP and microwave) and to identify which aspects are generic and which aspects are technology-specific for optical networks.</t>

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document considers the applicability of Abstraction and Control
   of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet Optical Integration
   (POI)in the context of IP/MPLS and optical internetworking. It
   identifies the YANG data models being defined by the IETF to support
   this deployment architecture and specific scenarios relevant for
   Service Providers.

   Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified for each
   multi-layer (packet over optical) scenario with a specific focus on
   the MPI (Multi-Domain Service Coordinator to Provisioning Network
   Controllers Interface)in the ACTN architecture.
