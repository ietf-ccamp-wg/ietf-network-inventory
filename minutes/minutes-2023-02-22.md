## Discussion

### Update README.md (PR #70)

The README file has been updated to:
- align the title and scope of the repository with the new title and abstract of the I-D
- update the references to the new github repository
- update the call details to the new CCAMP WG webex sessions

The PR has been reviewed and merged.

### Geolocation information (issue #62)

> Agreed to:
> - rename the "location" attribute as "room-location" and keep it optional to report the equipment-room postal address;
> - add a geolocation container for the GIS and defined it as optional
> 
> Two options to analyze:
> a) use the groupings defined in [RFC9179](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9179)
> b) use the geolocation-container grouping defined in [RFC8795](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8795)
> 

The information in the [RFC9179](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9179) grouping is a super-set of the information in [RFC8795](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8795) grouping

Advantages of [RFC8795](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8795):
- simpler
- sufficient to address the current use cases

Advantages of [RFC9179](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9179):
- canonical grouping (no need to justify why using this grouping)
- module intended only for import ([RFC8795](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8795) may not be always required to be implemented but would be need to be imported in order to use the grouping)

Using the grouping defined in [RFC9179](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9179) seems the safer approach for this draft

- [ ] **Chaode**: update the YANG model to (1) rename the "location" attribute as "room-location" (optional to report the equipment-room postal address) and (2) add a new container with the geolocation position using the grouping defined in [RFC9179](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9179)

### Bo WG adoption call comments (issue #60)

> 3) “equipment-room” definition is related to specific implementation. Could you change it to “site”?  For example, some enterprise networks can be distributed in different geographical areas, not limited to several equipment rooms. Generally, multiple racks are aggregated by “site”.
> 

Site is more generic:
- not all devices are located in rack (stand-alone devices)
- not all devices are located in a room (outdoor devices)
- not all devices have fixed location (mobile devices)

It is possible to generalize the model as:

```
     +--ro sites
     |  +--ro site* [uuid]
     |     +--ro uuid           yang:uuid
     |     ...
     |     +--ro site-location? string
     |     +--ro geo-location
     |     |   ...
     |     +--ro racks        // 0 or more racks
     |     |  +--ro rack* [uuid]
     |     |     +--ro uuid                 yang:uuid
     |     |     ...
     |     |     +--ro rack-location    // optional if not in an equipment-room
     |     |     |  +--ro equipment-room-name?   leafref
     |     |     |  +--ro row-number?            uint32
     |     |     |  +--ro column-number?         uint32
     |     |     ...
     |     |     +--ro contained-chassis* [ne-ref component-ref]
     |     |        +--ro ne-ref           leafref
     |     |        +--ro component-ref    leafref
     |     +--ro stand-alone-devices        // 0 or more stand-alone devices
     |        ...
```

In the context of a telecom network, the site always corresponds to an equipment-room

Need more time to double check whether this approach would be generic enough to cover all the use cases

We can further review and discuss this option in the next call(s)

### Addressing comments during WG adoption (Draft PR #67)

> - [x] **Chaode**: update the root container and start the PR review

> - [ ] **Aihua/Jeff/Sergio**: review the PR once ready for review

In order to simplify the review process using the github diffs, the filenames in the main branch have been updated and the branch of the PR rebased
