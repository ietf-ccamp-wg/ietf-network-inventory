#### Plan for calls after IETF 116 (issue #80)

Alternative option identified could be Monday 3pm CEST, starting from May 8, 2023

- [ ] **Italo**: check with other participants if Monday 3pm CEST is ok

## Discussion

### Model navigation between inventory and topology (issue #33)

This issue can be considered closed with PR #72

There is still the need to define the navigation from the link to the cable/fiber but this could be done only after the cable/fibre model is added to the inventory model (can be considered a different issue)

### Feedbacks from IETF 116

The main discussion items were about the creation of a new NIMBY WG within OPS Area

A draft charter is available at:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-nimby/

The main motivation is to have better coordination and alignment between the different drafts addressing inventory management

Jeff: from operator's perspective we need to fill a gap we have identified at the NBI of optical and IP controllers and the requirements are quite basic (network hardware inventory). I am a bit concerned by possible delays caused by expanding the scope of the work

The participants to the call agree with this concern

Chaode: we need to propose our data model to be used as the base inventory data model. If needed we can change the name of the model to allow adding software components to our data model as future extensions/augmentations

Italo: in order to speed up the work on network hardware inventory, I see two options:

1) use our model as the base model (including hardware inventory) and develop another model augmenting our model for software inventory

2) define one draft with a small base data model, re-define one model augmenting the base model for hardware inventory and develop another model augmenting the base model for software inventory

Aihua: option 1 is preferable to option 2 if the software components definition depend from the hardware component. However considering the inventory for e.g., virtual routers, it is not very clear what could be a common model

Phil: hardware and virtual routers look identical from an inventory point of view

Jeff: for troubleshooting you need to relate the virtual interface on the router with the physical interface on the server

Looking at draft-wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management-01, it seems that:
- hardware and virtual routers are managed as being the same management object (node) and distinguished by an is-virtual flag
- hardware and software components are managed as component and distinbuished by the class attribute

It has been agreed to further investigate how to develop a common inventory model, to propose to NIMBY WG, not to delay too much the work on the network hardware inventory
