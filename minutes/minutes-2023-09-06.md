## Discussion

### A proposal updating on draft & YANG module from Bo (issue #100)

Wu Bo presented some slides about the following use cases from draft-wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management and proposed the merged network inventory model :

1. Virtual devices, such as vCPE, vPE, vBNG, etc.
2. Software components, including device platform software, software patch, boot-rom, bootloader, etc.
3. Site as a location option
4. License list
5. Terms of network inventory, including network inventory, network element, and components
6. The merged network inventory model

The slides are available on github:

https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/ietf-network-inventory/files/12546315/IETF.network.inventory.use.cases.from.draft-wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory.pptx

 
Here is some feedback and summary got on the call:

1. Some authors say virtual device, and software components are not considered, as the purpose of CCAMP inventory is to meet ACTN Packet Optical integration (POI) requirements for optical and IP multi-domain TE cases etc, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability#section-4.
 
2. Some author shared the inventory information of Cisco vPE, indicating that virtual devices share the same inventory attributes just as physical devices:
