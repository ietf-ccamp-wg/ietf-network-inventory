## Discussion

### Updated text for IETF 117 (PR #98)

Review text proposal from Chaode to update the I-D text before IETF 117:
- aligned the YANG tree snapshots with the YANG model changes in PR #67
- added to describe the suggested pattern for the component location (based on ONF TR-547): fix #3
- added text to indicate that support for equipment-rooms and racks is optional: fix #7

More detailed text has to be provided to complete the specification of the component location format based on ONF TR-547. There are two options:
1. make a normative reference to ONF TR-547;
2. copy useful text from ONF TR-547.

- [ ] Italo/Nigel: to check offline whether it is possible to copy text from ONF TR-547

- [ ] Chaode/Italo: add Nigel as contributor to the I-D
