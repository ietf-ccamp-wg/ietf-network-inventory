## Discussion

### Plan for IETF 114

The current plan is to submit an update version of the I-D and request a presentation slot at CCAMP WG

For the updated YANG, we can progress the draft PR #43 adding any attributes [Attributes——0621.xlsx](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/files/9041401/Attributes.0621.xlsx) that is agreed

In the presentation we can:
- report the status of the discussion on scalability issues
- request more input from IP experts
- report the alignment between our model with RFC8348 and OpenConfig models

- [ ] Chaode: request a presentation slot for CCAMP WG
- [ ] Chaode: update the YANG model and I-D text in PR #43

Once the I-D is submitted, we can send an announce mail, with description of the changes and of open issues, to CCAMP WG, OPSAWG and Netmod WG

Deadline for I-D submission is July 11: we can review PR #43 in the next call on July 6

### Missing attributes from RFC8348 (issue #18)

> - [x] Jeff: check internally if RO is confirmed for network inventory info

It is confirmed that all the attributes in the inventory model should be RO

Review of the additional attributes provided by Chaode in [Attributes——0621.xlsx](https://github.com/italobusi/ietf-network-inventory/files/9041401/Attributes.0621.xlsx) and agreed that:
- proposed attributes for the equipment-room
  - country-or-region and province-or-state attributes should not be added since this information is already provided by the location attribute already existing in PR #43 (to be renamed as site-location)
  - rename the site attribute as site-name
  - the data type for the room-no should be string
  - remove the value unknown from the cable-layout-type and defent-static-floor attributes: the attribute can be omitted when not know
- proposed attributes for the ne:
  - the product-name is already existing in draft PR #43
  - clarify the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are to connect with the management system
