              draft-yg3bp-ccamp-optical-inventory-yang-00

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for optical network inventory
   data information.

   The YANG data model defined in this document is intended to be used
   as the basis toward a generic YANG data model for network inventory
   data information which can be augmented, when required, with
   technology-specific (e.g., optical) inventory data, to be defined
   either in a future version of this document or in another document.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

1.  Introduction

   Network inventory management is a key component in operators' OSS
   architectures.

   Network inventory is a foundamental functionality in network
   management and was specified many years ago.  Given the emerging of
   data model and their deployment in operator's management system, the
   traditional function is also requested to be defined as data model
   for inventory management.

   Network inventory management and monitoring is a critical part of
   ensuring the network stays healthy, well-planned, and functioning in
   the carriers network.  Network inventory management allows the
   operator to keep track of what physical network devices are staying
   in the network including relevant software and hardware.

   The network inventory management also helps the operator to know when
   to acquire new assets and what is needed, or to decommission old
   ones, which can help improving network performance and capacity
   planning.

   In [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] a gap was identified
   regarding the lack of a YANG data model that could be used at ACTN
   MPI interface level to report whole/partial hardware inventory
   information available at PNC level towards north bound systems (e.g.,
   MDSC or OSS layer).

   [RFC8345] initial goal was to make possible the augmentation of the
   YANG data model with network inventory data model but this was never
   developped and the scope was kept limited to network topology data
   only.

   It is key for operators to drive the industry towards the use of
   standard YANG data model for network inventory data instead of using
   vendors proprietary APIs (e.g., REST API).

   In the ACTN architecture this would bring also clear benefits at MDSC
   level for packet over optical integration scenarios since this would
   enable to correlate the inventory information with the links
   information reported in the network topology model.

   The intention is to define a generic YANG data model that would be as
   much as possible technology agnostic (valid for IP, optical and
   microwave networks) and that could be augmented, when required, to
   include some technology-specific inventory details.

   [RFC8348] defines a YANG data model for the management of the
   hardware on a single server and therefore it is more applicable to
   the PNC South Bound Interface (SBI) towards the network elements
   rather than at the PNC MPI.  However, the YANG data model defined in
   [RFC8348] has been used as a reference for defining the YANG network
   inventory data model.

   For optical network inventory, the network inventory YANG data model
   should support the use cases (4a and 4b) and requirements defined in
   [ONF_TR-547], in order to guarantee a seamless integration at
   MDSC/OSS/orchestration layers.

   The proposed YANG data model has been analysed to cover the
   requirements and use cases for Optical Network Inventory.

   Being based on [RFC8348], this data model should be a good starting
   point toward a generic data model and applicable to any technology.
   However, further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to
   extend the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of
   networks (IP and microwave) and to identify which aspects are generic
   and which aspects are tecnology-spefic for optical networks.

   This document defines one YANG module: ietf-network-inventory.yang
   (Section 4).

   Note: review in future versions of this document the related modules,
   depending on the augmentation relationship.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

2.  YANG Data Model for Optical Network Inventory

2.1.  YANG Model Overview

   Based on TMF classification in [TMF-MTOSI], inventory objects can be
   divided into two groups, holder group and equipment group.  The
   holder group contains rack, shelf, slot, subslot while the equipment
   group contains network-element, board and port.  With the requirement
   of GIS and on-demand domain controller selection raised, equipment
   room becomes a new inventory object to be managed besides TMF
   classification.

   Logically, the relationship between these inventory objects can be
   described by Figure 1 below:

              Figure 1: Relationship between inventory objects

   In [RFC8348], rack, shelf, slot, subslot, board and port are defined
   as component of network element with generic attributes.

   While [RFC8348] is used to manage the hardware of a single server
   (e.g., a Network Element), the Network Inventory YANG data model is
   used to retrieve the network inventory information that a controller
   discovers from multiple Network Elements under its control.

Internet-Draft           Optical Inventory YANG             October 2021


   However, the YANG data model defined in [RFC8348] has been used as a
   reference for defining the YANG network inventory data model.  This
   approach can simplify the implementation of this network inventory
   model when the controller uses the YANG data model defined in
   [RFC8348] to retrieve the hardware configuration from the network
   elements under its control.

   Note: review in future versions of this document which attributes
   from [RFC8348] are required also for network inventory and whether
   there attributes not defined in [RFC8348]which are required for
   network inventory

   Note: review in future versions of this document whether to re-use
   definitions from [RFC8348] or use schema-mount

   TBD: add some overview of the tree (network-inventory, rooms and
   network-elements lists)

   The YANG data model for network inventory follows the same approach
   of [RFC8348] and reports the network inventory as a list of
   components of different types (e.g., chassis, module, port).

   TBD: add some overview of the tree of the component list

   Note: review in future versions of this document whether the
   component list should be under the network-inventory instead of under
   the network-element container

   However, considering there are some special scenario, the
   relationship between rack and network element is not 1 to 1.  Network
   element cannot be the direct parent node of rack.  So there should be
   a rack list under the equipment room and acts to be a brother node of
   network element list.  And the shelfs in the rack should have some
   reference information to the component.

   Note that in [RFC8345], topology and inventory are two subsets of
   network information.  However, considering the complexity of the
   existing topology models and to have a better extension capability,
   we define a separate root for inventory model.  We will consider some
   other ways to do some associations between topology model and
   inventory model in the future.

   Note: review in future versions of this document whether network
   inventory should be defined as an augmentation of the network model
   defined in [RFC8345] instead of under a new network-inventory root

   The proposed YANG data model has been analysed to cover the
   requirements and use cases for Optical Network Inventory.

   Further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to extend
   the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of networks
   (IP and microwave) and to identify which aspects are generic and
   which aspects are tecnology-spefic for optical networks.
