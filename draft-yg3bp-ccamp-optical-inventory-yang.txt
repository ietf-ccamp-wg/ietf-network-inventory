            A YANG Data Model for Optical Network Inventory
                draft-xx-ccamp-optical-inventory-yang-00

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for optical network inventory
   data information.

   Future versions of this document may define a generic YANG data model
   for network inventory data information which can be augmented, when
   required, with technology-specific (e.g., optical) inventory data.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

1.  Introduction

   Network inventory management is a key component in operators' OSS
   architectures.

   In [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] a gap was identified
   regarding the lack of a YANG data model that could be used at ACTN
   MPI interface level to report whole/partial hardware inventory
   information available at PNC level towards north bound systems (e.g.,
   MDSC or OSS layer).

   [RFC8345] initial goal was to make possible the augmentation of the
   YANG data model with network inventory data model but this was never
   developped and the scope was kept limited to network topology data
   only.

Internet-Draft           Optical Inventory YANG             October 2021


   It is key for operators to drive the industry towards the use of
   standard YANG data model for network inventory data instead of using
   vendors proprietary APIs (e.g., REST API).

   In the ACTN architecture this would bring also clear benefits at MDSC
   level for packet over optical integration scenarios since this would
   enable to correlate the inventory information with the links
   information reported in the network topology model.

   The intention is to define a generic YANG data model that would be as
   much as possible technology agnostic (valid for IP, optical and
   microwave networks) and that could be augmented, when required, to
   include some technology-specific inventory details.

   [RFC8348] defines a YANG data model for the management of the
   hardware on a single server and therefore it is more applicable to
   the PNC South Bound Interface (SBI) towards the network elements
   rather than at the PNC MPI.  However, the YANG data model defined in
   [RFC8348] has been used as a reference for defining the YANG network
   inventory data model.

   For optical network inventory, the network inventory YANG data model
   should support the use cases (4a and 4b) and requirements defined in
   [ONF_TR-547], in order to guarantee a seamless integration at
   MDSC/OSS/orchestration layers.

   The proposed YANG data model has been analysed to cover the
   requirements and use cases for Optical Network Inventory.

   Further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to extend
   the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of networks
   (IP and microwave) and to identify which aspects are generic and
   which aspects are tecnology-spefic for optical networks.

   This document defines one YANG module: TBD (Section 4).

   Note: review in future versions of this document the related modules,
   depending on the augmentation relationship.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

   *  data model

   *  data node

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   *  configuration data

   *  state data

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

   TBD: Recap the concept of chassis/slot/component/board/... in TMF.

   Following terms are used for representation of the hierarchies in the
   optical network inventory.

   Network Element:

   Cabinet&#65306;a combination of rack, chassis and shelf.

   Chassis:

   Slot:

   Component:

   Board/Card:

1.2.  Tree Diagram

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   Section 3 of this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these
   diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

1.3.  Prefix in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in the following table.

2.  YANG Data Model for Optical Network Inventory

2.1.  YANG Model Overview

   The YANG model for optical network inventory ...

   TBD: add some overview of the tree (network-inventory, rooms and
   network-elements lists)

   Note: review in future versions of this document whether network
   inventory should be defined as an augmentation of the network model
   defined in [RFC8345] instead of under a new network-inventory root

   TBD: add some overview of the tree of the equiment rooms

   The YANG data model for network inventory follows the same approach
   of [RFC8348] and reports the network inventory as a list of
   components of different types (e.g., chassis, module, port).

   TBD: add some overview of the tree of the component list

   Note: review in future versions of this document whether the
   component list should be under the network-inventory instead of under
   the network-element container

   While [RFC8348] is used to manage the hardware of a single server
   (e.g., a Network Element), the Network Inventory YANG data model is
   used to retrieve the network inventory information that a controller
   discovers from multiple Network Elements under its control.

   However, the YANG data model defined in [RFC8348] has been used as a
   reference for defining the YANG network inventory data model.

   Note: review in future versions of this document which attributes
   from [RFC8348] are required also for network inventory and whether
   there attributes not defined in [RFC8348]which are required for
   network inventory

   Note: review in future versions of this document whether to re-use
   definitions from [RFC8348] or use schema-mount

   The proposed YANG data model has been analysed to cover the
   requirements and use cases for Optical Network Inventory.

   Further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to extend
   the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of networks
   (IP and microwave) and to identify which aspects are generic and
   which aspects are tecnology-spefic for optical networks.
