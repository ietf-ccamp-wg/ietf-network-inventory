1.  Introduction

   Network hardware inventory management is a key component in
   operators' OSS architectures.

   Network inventory is a fundamental functionality in network
   management and was specified many years ago.  Given the emerging of
   data models and their deployment in operator's management and control
   systems, the traditional function of inventory management is also
   requested to be defined as a data model.

   Network inventory management and monitoring is a critical part of
   ensuring the network stays healthy, well-planned, and functioning in
   the operator's network.  Network inventory management allows the
   operator to keep track of what physical network devices are staying
   in the network including relevant software and hardware.

   The network inventory management also helps the operator to know when
   to acquire new assets and what is needed, or to decommission old or
   faulty ones, which can help to improve network performance and
   capacity planning.

   In [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] a gap was identified
   regarding the lack of a YANG data model that could be used at ACTN
   MPI interface level to report whole/partial hardware inventory
   information available at PNC level towards north-bound systems (e.g.,
   MDSC or OSS layer).

   [RFC8345] initial goal was to make possible the augmentation of the
   YANG data model with network inventory data model but this was never
   developed and the scope was kept limited to network topology data
   only.

   It is key for operators to drive the industry towards the use of a
   standard YANG data model for network inventory data instead of using
   vendors proprietary APIs (e.g., REST API).

   In the ACTN architecture, this would bring also clear benefits at
   MDSC level for packet over optical integration scenarios since this
   would enable the correlation of the inventory information with the
   links information reported in the network topology model.

   The intention is to define a generic YANG data model that would be as
   much as possible technology agnostic (valid for IP, optical and
   microwave networks) and that could be augmented, when required, to
   include some technology-specific inventory details.

   [RFC8348] defines a YANG data model for the management of the
   hardware on a single server and therefore it is more applicable to
   the PNC South Bound Interface (SBI) towards the network elements
   rather than at the PNC MPI.  However, the YANG data model defined in
   [RFC8348] has been used as a reference for defining the YANG network
   hardware inventory data model.

   For optical network hardware inventory, the network inventory YANG
   data model should support the use cases (4a and 4b) and requirements
   defined in [ONF_TR-547], in order to guarantee a seamless integration
   at MDSC/OSS/orchestration layers.

   The proposed YANG data model has been analyzed to cover the
   requirements and use cases for Optical Network Hardware Inventory.

   Being based on [RFC8348], this data model should be a good starting
   point toward a generic data model and applicable to any technology.
   However, further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to
   extend the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of
   networks (IP and microwave) and to identify which aspects are generic
   and which aspects are technology-specific for optical networks.

   This document defines one YANG module: ietf-network-inventory.yang
   (Section 4).

   Note: review in future versions of this document the related modules,
   depending on the augmentation relationship.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

2.  YANG Data Model for Network Hardware Inventory

2.1.  YANG Model Overview

   Based on TMF classification in [TMF-MTOSI], inventory objects can be
   divided into two groups, holder group and equipment group.  The
   holder group contains rack, chassis, slot, sub-slot while the
   equipment group contains network-element, board and port.  With the
   requirement of GIS and on-demand domain controller selection raised,
   the equipment room becomes a new inventory object to be managed
   besides TMF classification.

   Logically, the relationship between these inventory objects can be
   described by Figure 1 below:

              Figure 1: Relationship between inventory objects

   In [RFC8348], rack, chassis, slot, sub-slot, board and port are
   defined as components of network elements with generic attributes.

   While [RFC8348] is used to manage the hardware of a single server
   (e.g., a Network Element), the Network Inventory YANG data model is
   used to retrieve the network hardware inventory information that a
   controller discovers from multiple Network Elements under its
   control.

   However, the YANG data model defined in [RFC8348] has been used as a
   reference for defining the YANG network inventory data model.  This
   approach can simplify the implementation of this network hardware

   in [RFC8348] to retrieve the hardware from the network elements under
   its control.

   Note: review in future versions of this document which attributes
   from [RFC8348] are required also for network hardware inventory and
   whether there are attributes not defined in [RFC8348] which are
   required for network hardware inventory

   definitions from [RFC8348] or use schema-mount.

   The YANG data model for network hardware inventory follows the same
   approach of [RFC8348] and reports the network hardware inventory as a
   list of components with different types (e.g., chassis, module,
   port).

   Note: review in future versions of this document whether the
   component list should be under the network-inventory instead of under
   the network-element container

   However, considering there are some special scenarios, the
   relationship between the rack and network elements is not 1 to 1 nor
   1 to n.  The network element cannot be the direct parent node of the
   rack.  So there should be n to m relationship between racks and
   network elements.  And the chassis in the rack should have some
   reference information to the component.

   Note that in [RFC8345], topology and inventory are two subsets of
   network information.  However, considering the complexity of the
   existing topology models and to have a better extension capability,
   we define a separate root for the inventory model.  We will consider
   some other ways to do some associations between the topology model
   and inventory model in the future.

   Note: review in future versions of this document whether network
   hardware inventory should be defined as an augmentation of the
   network model defined in [RFC8345] instead of under a new network-
   inventory root.

   The proposed YANG data model has been analysed to cover the
   requirements and use cases for Optical Network Inventory.

   Further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to extend
   the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of networks
   (IP and microwave) and to identify which aspects are generic and
   which aspects are technology-specific for optical networks.

2.2.  Efficiency Issue

   During doing the design of integration with OSS, some efficiency
   issues have been discovered.  More discussion is needed to be done in
   the future to address this issue.

   Considering relational database is widely used by traditional OSS
   systems and part of PNCs, the inventory objects are probably saved in
   different tables.  If the generic model is adopted, when doing a full
   amount synchronization, PNC needs to convert all inventory objects of
   each NE into component objects and mix them together into a list, and
   then construct a response and send to OSS or MDSC.  The OSS or MDSC
   needs to classify the component list and devide them into different
   groups, in order to save them in different tables.  The mixing-
   regrouping steps are actually waste of effort.

   And this efficiency issue will be more serious in a larger scale of
   network.
