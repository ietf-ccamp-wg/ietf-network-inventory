            A YANG Data Model for Optical Network Inventory
                draft-xx-ccamp-optical-inventory-yang-00

Abstract

   Network inventory is a foundamental functionality in network
   management and was specified many years ago.  Given the emerging of
   data model and their deployment in operator's management system, the
   traditional function is also requested to be defined as data model
   for inventory management.

   This document defines the YANG data model for optical network
   inventory information.  The YANG data model defined in this document
   conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

1.  Introduction

   Network inventory management and monitoring is a critical part of
   ensuring the network stays healthy, well-planned, and functioning in
   the carriers network.  Network inventory management allows the
   operator to keep track of what physical network devices are staying
   in the network including relevant software and hardware.

   The network inventory management also helps the operator to know when
   to acquire new assets and what is needed, or to decommission old
   ones, which can help improving network performance and capacity
   planning.

   This document defines one YANG module: TBD (Section 4).  This
   document augments the generic network model [RFC8345].

   TBD: review the related modules, depending on the augmentation
   relationship.  TBD: give the augmentation relationship.

   The proposed YANG data model has been analysed to cover the
   requirements and use cases for Optical Network Inventory.

   Further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to extend
   the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of networks.

1.1.  Terminology and Notations

   Refer to [RFC7446] and [RFC7581] for the key terms used in this
   document.  The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are not
   redefined here:

   o  client

   o  server

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  configuration data

   o  state data

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

   TBD: Recap the concept of chassis/slot/component/board/... in TMF.

   Following terms are used for representation of the hierarchies in the
   optical network inventory.

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   Section 3 of this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these
   diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in the following table.

   network model defined in [RFC8345], as described in Figure 1 of

   The YANG data model for network inventory follows the same approach
   of [RFC8348] and reports the network inventory as a list of
   components of different types (e.g., chassis, module, port).

   TBD whether the component list is under the network or under the node
   container

   TBD whether to re-use definitions from [RFC8348] or use schema-mount

   While [RFC8348] is used to manage the hardware of a single server
   (e.g., a Network Element), the Network Inventory YANG data model is
   used to retrieve the network inventory information that a controller
   that discovers it from multiple Network Elements it controls.

   The proposed YANG data model has been analysed to cover the
   requirements and use cases for Optical Network Inventory.

   Further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to extend
   the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of networks.
