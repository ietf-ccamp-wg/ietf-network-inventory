<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>Network hardware inventory management is a key component in operators' OSS architectures.</t>

<t>Network inventory is a fundamental functionality in network management and was specified many years ago. Given the emerging of data models and their deployment in operator's management and control systems, the traditional function of inventory management is also requested to be defined as a data model.</t>

<t>Network inventory management and monitoring is a critical part for ensuring the network stays healthy, well-planned, and functioning in the operator's network. Network inventory management allows the operator to keep track of what physical network devices are staying  in the network including relevant software and hardware versions.</t>

<t>The network inventory management also helps the operator to know when to acquire new assets and what is needed, or to decommission old or faulty ones, which can help to improve network performance and capacity planning.</t>

<t>In <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability"/> a gap was identified regarding the lack of a YANG data model that could be used at ACTN MPI interface level to report whole/partial network hardware inventory information available at domain controller level towards north-bound systems (e.g., MDSC or OSS layer).</t>

<t><xref target="RFC8345"/> initial goal was to make possible the augmentation of the YANG data model with network inventory data model but this was never developed and the scope was kept limited to network topology data only.</t>

<t>It is key for operators to drive the industry towards the use of a standard YANG data model for network inventory data instead of using vendors proprietary APIs (e.g., REST API).</t>

<t>In the ACTN architecture, this would bring also clear benefits at MDSC level for packet over optical integration scenarios since this would enable the correlation of the inventory information with the links information reported in the network topology model.</t>

<t>The intention is to define a generic YANG data model that would be as much as possible technology agnostic (valid for IP, optical and microwave networks) and that could be augmented, when required, to include some technology-specific inventory details.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC8348"/> defines a YANG data model for the management of the hardware on a single server and therefore it is more applicable to the domain controller South Bound Interface (SBI) towards the network elements rather than at the domain controller's northbound. However, the YANG data model defined in <xref target="RFC8348"/> has been used as a reference for defining the YANG network hardware inventory data model presented in this draft.</t>

<t>For optical network hardware inventory, the network inventory YANG data model should support the use cases (4a and 4b) and requirements as defined in <xref target="ONF_TR-547"/>, in order to guarantee a seamless integration at MDSC/OSS/orchestration layers.</t>

<t>The proposed YANG data model has been analysed at the present stage to cover the requirements and use cases for Optical Network Hardware Inventory.</t>

<t>Being based on <xref target="RFC8348"/>, this data model should be a good starting point toward a generic data model and applicable to any technology. However, further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to extend the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of networks (IP and microwave) and to identify which aspects are generic and which aspects are technology-specific for optical networks.</t>

<t>This document defines one YANG module: ietf-network-inventory (<xref target="ni-yang"/>).</t>

<t>Note: review in future versions of this document the related modules, depending on the augmentation relationship.</t>

<t>The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>

<t>Based on TMF classification in <xref target="TMF_SD2-20"/>, inventory objects can be divided into two groups, holder group and equipment group. The holder group contains rack, chassis, slot, sub-slot while the equipment group contains network-element, board and port. With the requirement of GIS and on-demand domain controller selection raised, the equipment room becomes a new inventory object to be managed besides TMF classification.</t>

<t>Logically,  the relationship between these inventory objects can be described by <xref target="fig-inventory-object-relationship"/> below:</t>

<t>In <xref target="RFC8348"/>, rack, chassis, slot, sub-slot, board and port are defined as components of network elements with generic attributes.</t>

<t>Considering there are some special scenarios, there is no direct relationship between the rack and network element. In some cases, one network element contains multiple racks while in other cases one rack contains several shelves belonging to one or more network elements.</t>

<t>While <xref target="RFC8348"/> is used to manage the hardware of a single server (e.g., a network element), the Network Inventory YANG data model is used to retrieve the network hardware inventory information that a controller discovers from all the network elements under its control.</t>

<t>However, the YANG data model defined in <xref target="RFC8348"/> has been used as a reference for defining the YANG network inventory data model. This approach can simplify the implementation of this network hardware inventory model when the controller uses the YANG data model defined in <xref target="RFC8348"/> to retrieve the hardware  from the network elements under its control.</t>

<t>Note: review in future versions of this document whether to re-use definitions from <xref target="RFC8348"/> or use schema-mount.</t>

<section anchor="common-design-for-all-inventory-objects"><name>Common Design for All Inventory Objects</name>

<t>For all the inventory objects, there are some common attributes existing. Such as:</t>

<t>Identifier: here we suggest to use uuid format which is widely implemented with systems. It is guaranteed to be globally unique.</t>

<t>Name: name is a human-readable label information which could be used to present on GUI. This name is suggested to be provided by server.</t>

<t>Alias: alias is also a human-readable label information which could be modified by user. It could also be present on GUI instead of name.</t>

<t>Description: description is a human-readable information which could be also input by user. Description provides more detailed information to prompt users when performing maintenance operations.</t>

<t>Location: location is a common management requirement of operators. This location could be an absolute position (e.g. mailing address), or a relative position (e.g. port index). Different types of inventory objects may require different types of position.</t>

<t>Some of the definitions taken from <xref target="RFC8348"/> are actually based on the ENTITY-MIB <xref target="RFC6933"/>.</t>

<t>For state data like admin-state, oper-state and so on, we consider they are related to device hardware management and not hardware inventory. Therefore, they are outside of scope of this document. Same for the sensor-data, they should be defined in some other performance monitoring data models instead of inventory data model.</t>

<t>We re-defined some attributes listed in <xref target="RFC8348"/>, based on some integration experience for network wide inventory data.</t>

<section anchor="new-parent-identifiers-reference"><name>New Parent Identifiers' Reference</name>

<t><xref target="RFC8348"/> provided a "parent-ref" attribute, which was an identifier reference to its parent component. When the MDSC or OSS systems want to find this component's grandparent or higher level component in the hierarchy, they need to retrieve this parent-ref step by step. To reduce this iterative work, we decided to provide a list of hierarchical parent components' identifier references.</t>

<t>According to the management requirements from operators, some important attributes are not defined in <xref target="RFC8348"/>. These attributes could be component-specific and are not suitable to define under the component list node. So, we defined a choice-case structure for this component-specific extension, as follows:</t>

<section anchor="relationship-between-hardware-inventory-and-network-topology-models"><name>Relationship between Hardware Inventory and Network Topology models</name>

<t>Network topology is a logical abstraction based on hardware inventory objects. The abstraction may be based on technology requirements (e.g., layer 0 or layer 1 resources) or on some specific requirements (e.g., for path computation or service provisioning).</t>

<t>Therefore the relationship between hardware inventory objects and network topology objects can be 1:N (N&gt;=1).</t>

<t>Taking the Optical technology as example, an Optical Transport Network (OTN) Network Element (NE) can be installed with several kinds of boards, including an Ethernet client signal switching board, a line board which is used for OTN layer switching. This line board may also be used as a start point of WDM layer. In terms of technologies, this OTN NE supports multi-layer network topology connections, so that it should appear in L0, L1 and L2 network topology.</t>

<t>It is important to describe this relationship for the sake of network Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M). For example, the actual path of a connection is described by the objects in network topology. When there is a failure along this connection, the O&amp;M engineers are more concerned with the physical location information behind the network objects for trouble shooting.</t>

<t>Generally speaking, a node object in the network topology corresponds to a network element object in the hardware inventory. A Link Termination Point (LTP) object in the network topology corresponds to a port component in the hardware inventory. A link object in the network topology corresponds to a fiber/cable object in the hardware inventory.</t>

<t>NOTE: take fiber&amp;cable object into scope in the future version.</t>

<t>Compared with network topology, hardware inventory objects are the most basic elements of network: from the automation integration perspective, the MDSC or OSS systems would integrate with hardware inventory data before network topology data.</t>

<t>Therefore it is better to keep separated the network topology information and the hardware inventory information: the ietf-hw-inventory-ref-topo YANG module provides this relationship augmenting the network topology model, when required, with references between network topology objects and corresponding hardware inventory objects.</t>

<t>NOTE: add the figure with the relationship between the three modules (see slide from 2023-03-08 meeting)</t>

<t>NOTE: the association between a link and a fiber&amp;cable object has to be added in the future version.</t>

<section anchor="efficiency-issue"><name>Efficiency Issue</name>

<t>During  the integration with OSS in some operators, some efficiency/scalability concerns have been discovered when synchronizing network inventory data for big networks.  More discussions are needed to address these concerns.</t>

<t>Considering that relational databases are widely used by traditional OSS systems and also by some network controllers, the inventory objects are most likely to be saved in different tables. With the model defined in current draft, when doing a full synchronization, network controller needs to convert all inventory objects of each NE into component objects and combine them together into a single list, and then construct a response and send to OSS or MDSC. The OSS or MDSC needs to classify the component list and divide them into different groups, in order to save them in different tables. The combining-regrouping steps are impacting the network controller &amp; OSS/MDSC processing, which may result in efficiency/scalability limitations in large scale networks.</t>

<t>An alternative YANG model structure, which defines the inventory objects directly, instead of defining generic components, has also been analyzed. However, also with this model, there still could be some scalability limitations when synchronizing full inventory resources in large scale of networks. This scalability limitation is caused by the limited transmission capabilities of HTTP protocol. We think that this scalability limitation should be solved at protocol level rather than data model level.</t>

<t>The model proposed by this draft is designed to be as generic as possible so to cover future special types of inventory objects that could be used in other technologies, that have not been identified yet. If the inventory objects were to be defined directly with fixed hierarchical relationships in YANG model, this new type of inventory objects needs to be manually defined, which is not a backward compatible change and therefore is not an acceptable approach for implementation. With a generic model, it is only needed to augment a new component class and extend some specific attributes for this new inventory component class, which is more flexible. We consider that this generic data model, enabling a flexible and backward compatible approach for other technologies, represents the main scope of this draft. Solution description to efficiency/scalability limitations mentioned above is considered as out-of-scope.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="some-other-considerations"><name>Some Other Considerations</name>

<t>Note: review in future versions of this document whether the component list should be under the network-inventory instead of the network-element container.</t>

<t>Note that in <xref target="RFC8345"/>, topology and inventory are two subsets of network information. However, considering the complexity of the existing topology models and having a better extension capability, we define a separate root for the inventory model. We will consider some other ways to do some associations between the topology model and inventory model in the future.</t>

<t>Note: review in future versions of this document whether network hardware inventory should be defined as an augmentation of the network model defined in <xref target="RFC8345"/> instead of under a new network-inventory root.</t>

<t>The proposed YANG data model has been analysed so far to cover the requirements and use cases for Optical Network Inventory.</t>

<t>Further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to extend the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of networks (IP and microwave) and to identify which aspects are generic and which aspects are technology-specific for optical.</t>

<title>The YANG 1.1 Data Modeling Language</title>
<author fullname='M. Bjorklund' initials='M.' role='editor' surname='Bjorklund'><organization/></author>
<date month='August' year='2016'/>
<abstract><t>YANG is a data modeling language used to model configuration data, state data, Remote Procedure Calls, and notifications for network management protocols.  This document describes the syntax and semantics of version 1.1 of the YANG language.  YANG version 1.1 is a maintenance release of the YANG language, addressing ambiguities and defects in the original specification.  There are a small number of backward incompatibilities from YANG version 1.  This document also specifies the YANG mappings to the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF).</t></abstract>

<section anchor="comparison-with-openconfig-platform-data-model"><name>Comparison With Openconfig-platform Data Model</name>

<t>Since more and more devices can be managed by domain controller through OpenConfig, to avoid that our inventory data model cannot cover these devices' inventory data, we have compared our inventory data model with the YANG module openconfig-platform which is the data model used to manage inventory information in OpenConfig.</t>

<t>Openconfig-platform data model is NE-level and uses a generic component concept to describe its inner devices and containers, which is similar to ietf-hardware model in <xref target="RFC8348"/>. Since we have also reused the component concept of <xref target="RFC8348"/> in our inventory data model, we can compare the component's attributes between openconfig-platform and our model directly , which is stated below:</t>

</texttable>

<t>As it mentioned in <xref target="reference-RFC8348"/> that state data and performance data are out of scope of our data model, it is same for alarm data and it should be defined in some other alarm data models separately. And for some component specific structures in openconfig-platform, we consider some of them can be contained by our existing structure, such as fan, backplane, and controller-card. And for some of them, there is no need to manage for operators, such as storage and cpu.</t>

<t>Mostly, our inventory data model can cover the attributes from OpenConfig.</t>
