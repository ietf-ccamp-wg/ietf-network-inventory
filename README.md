## Abstract

This document defines a YANG data model for network hardware inventory data information.

The YANG data model presented in this document is intended to be used as the basis toward a generic YANG data model for network hardware inventory data information which can be augmented, when required, with technology-specific (e.g., optical) inventory data, to be defined either in a future version of this document or in another document.

The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).
