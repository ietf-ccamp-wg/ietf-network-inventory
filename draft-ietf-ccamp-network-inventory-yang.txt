1.  Introduction

   Network hardware inventory management is a key component in
   operators' OSS architectures.

   Network inventory is a fundamental functionality in network
   management and was specified many years ago.  Given the emerging of
   data models and their deployment in operator's management and control
   systems, the traditional function of inventory management is also
   requested to be defined as a data model.

   Network inventory management and monitoring is a critical part for
   ensuring the network stays healthy, well-planned, and functioning in
   the operator's network.  Network inventory management allows the
   operator to keep track of what physical network devices are staying
   in the network including relevant software and hardware versions.

   The network inventory management also helps the operator to know when
   to acquire new assets and what is needed, or to decommission old or
   faulty ones, which can help to improve network performance and
   capacity planning.

   In [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] a gap was identified
   regarding the lack of a YANG data model that could be used at ACTN
   MPI interface level to report whole/partial network hardware
   inventory information available at domain controller level towards
   north-bound systems (e.g., MDSC or OSS layer).

   [RFC8345] initial goal was to make possible the augmentation of the
   YANG data model with network inventory data model but this was never
   developed and the scope was kept limited to network topology data
   only.

   It is key for operators to drive the industry towards the use of a
   standard YANG data model for network inventory data instead of using
   vendors proprietary APIs (e.g., REST API).

   In the ACTN architecture, this would bring also clear benefits at
   MDSC level for packet over optical integration scenarios since this
   would enable the correlation of the inventory information with the
   links information reported in the network topology model.

Internet-Draft           Network Inventory YANG             January 2023


   The intention is to define a generic YANG data model that would be as
   much as possible technology agnostic (valid for IP, optical and
   microwave networks) and that could be augmented, when required, to
   include some technology-specific inventory details.

   [RFC8348] defines a YANG data model for the management of the
   hardware on a single server and therefore it is more applicable to
   the domain controller South Bound Interface (SBI) towards the network
   elements rather than at the domain controller's northbound.  However,
   the YANG data model defined in [RFC8348] has been used as a reference
   for defining the YANG network hardware inventory data model presented
   in this draft.

   For optical network hardware inventory, the network inventory YANG
   data model should support the use cases (4a and 4b) and requirements
   as defined in [ONF_TR-547], in order to guarantee a seamless
   integration at MDSC/OSS/orchestration layers.

   The proposed YANG data model has been analysed at the present stage
   to cover the requirements and use cases for Optical Network Hardware
   Inventory.

   Being based on [RFC8348], this data model should be a good starting
   point toward a generic data model and applicable to any technology.
   However, further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to
   extend the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of
   networks (IP and microwave) and to identify which aspects are generic
   and which aspects are technology-specific for optical networks.

   This document defines one YANG module: ietf-network-inventory.yang
   (Section 4).

   Note: review in future versions of this document the related modules,
   depending on the augmentation relationship.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

2.1.  YANG Model Overview

   Based on TMF classification in [TMF-MTOSI], inventory objects can be
   divided into two groups, holder group and equipment group.  The
   holder group contains rack, chassis, slot, sub-slot while the
   equipment group contains network-element, board and port.  With the
   requirement of GIS and on-demand domain controller selection raised,
   the equipment room becomes a new inventory object to be managed
   besides TMF classification.

   Logically, the relationship between these inventory objects can be
   described by Figure 1 below:

                   +-------------+
                   |  inventory  |
                   +-------------+
                       // \\
                 1:N  //   \\ 1:M
                     //     \\

Internet-Draft           Network Inventory YANG             January 2023


   In [RFC8348], rack, chassis, slot, sub-slot, board and port are
   defined as components of network elements with generic attributes.

   Considering there are some special scenarios, there is no direct
   relationship between the rack and network element.  In some cases,
   one network element contains multiple racks while in other cases one
   rack contains several shelves belonging to one or more network
   elements.

   While [RFC8348] is used to manage the hardware of a single server
   (e.g., a network element), the Network Inventory YANG data model is
   used to retrieve the network hardware inventory information that a
   controller discovers from all the network elements under its control.

   However, the YANG data model defined in [RFC8348] has been used as a
   reference for defining the YANG network inventory data model.  This
   approach can simplify the implementation of this network hardware
   inventory model when the controller uses the YANG data model defined
   in [RFC8348] to retrieve the hardware from the network elements under
   its control.

   Note: review in future versions of this document whether to re-use
   definitions from [RFC8348] or use schema-mount.

2.1.1.  Common Design for All Inventory Objects

   For all the inventory objects, there are some common attributes
   existing.  Such as:

   Identifier: here we suggest to use uuid format which is widely
   implemented with systems.  It is guaranteed to be globally unique.

   Name: name is a human-readable label information which could be used
   to present on GUI.  This name is suggested to be provided by server.

   Alias: alias is also a human-readable label information which could
   be modified by user.  It could also be present on GUI instead of
   name.

   Description: description is a human-readable information which could
   be also input by user.  Description provides more detailed
   information to prompt users when performing maintenance operations.

   Location: location is a common management requirement of operators.
   This location could be an absolute position (e.g. mailing address),
   or a relative position (e.g. port index).  Different types of
   inventory objects may require different types of position.

2.1.2.  Reference from RFC8348

   The YANG data model for network hardware inventory mainly follows the
   same approach of [RFC8348] and reports the network hardware inventory
   as a list of components with different types (e.g., chassis, module,
   port).

   For state data like admin-state, oper-state and so on, we consider
   they are related to device hardware management and not hardware
   inventory.  Therefore, they are outside of scope of this document.
   Same for the sensor-data, they should be defined in some other
   performance monitoring data models instead of inventory data model.

   We re-defined some attributes listed in [RFC8348], based on some
   integration experience for network wide inventory data.

2.1.3.  Changes with respect to RFC8348

2.1.3.1.  New Parent Identifiers' Reference

   [RFC8348] provided a "parent-ref" attribute, which was an identifier
   reference to its parent component.  When the MDSC or OSS systems want
   to find this component's grandparent or higher level component in the
   hierarchy, they need to retrieve this parent-ref step by step.  To
   reduce this iterative work, we decided to provide a list of
   hierarchical parent components' identifier references.

     +--ro components
        +--ro component* [uuid]
           ...................................
           +--ro parent-references
           |  +--ro equipment-room-uuid?    leafref
           |  +--ro ne-uuid?                leafref
           |  +--ro rack-uuid?              leafref
           |  +--ro component-references
           |     +--ro component-reference* [index]
           |        +--ro index    uint8
           |        +--ro class?   leafref
           |        +--ro uuid?    leafref
           ...................................

   The hierarchical components' identifier could be found by the
   "component-reference" list.  The "index" attribute is used to order
   the list by the hierarchical relationship from topmost component
   (with the "index" set to 0) to bottom component.

2.1.3.2.  Component-Specific Info Design

   According to the management requirements from operators, some
   important attributes are not defined in [RFC8348].  These attributes
   could be component-specific and are not suitable to define under the
   component list node.  So, we defined a choice-case structure for this
   component-specific extension, as follows:

     +--ro components
        +--ro component* [uuid]
           ...................................
           +--ro (component-class)?
              +--:(chassis)
              |  +--ro chassis-specific-info
              +--:(container)
              |  +--ro slot-specific-info
              +--:(module)
              |  +--ro board-specific-info
              +--:(port)
                 +--ro port-specific-info
           ...................................

   Note: The detail of each *-specific-info YANG container is still
   under discussion, and the leaf attributes will be defined in future.

2.1.3.3.  Part Number

   According to the description in [RFC8348], the attribute named
   "model-name" under the component, is preferred to have a customer-
   visible part number value.  "Model-name" is not straightforward to
   understand and we suggest to rename it as "part-number" directly.

        +--ro component* [uuid]

2.1.4.  Equipment Room

   Note: add some more attributes about equipment room in the future.

2.1.5.  Rack

   Besides the common attributes mentioned in above section, rack could
   have some specific attributes, such as appearance-related attributes
   and electricity-related attributes.  The height, depth and width are
   described by the figure below (please consider that the door of the
   rack is facing the user):

2.1.6.  Network Element

   We consider that some of the attributes defined in [RFC8348] for
   components are also applicable for network element.  These attributes
   include:

         +--ro network-elements
            +--ro network-element* [uuid]
               ...................................
               +--ro hardware-rev?    string
               +--ro firmware-rev?    string
               +--ro software-rev?    string
               +--ro mfg-name?        string
               +--ro mfg-date?        yang:date-and-time
               +--ro part-number?     string
               +--ro serial-number?   string
               +--ro product-name?    string
               ...................................

   Note: Not all the attributes defined in [RFC8348] are applicable for
   network element.  And there could also be some missing attributes
   which are not recognized by [RFC8348].  More extensions could be
   introduced in later revisions after the missing attributes are fully
   discussed.

2.2.  Efficiency Issue

   During the integration with OSS in some operators, some efficiency/
   scalability concerns have been discovered when synchronizing network
   inventory data for big networks.  More discussions are needed to
   address these concerns.

   Considering that relational databases are widely used by traditional
   OSS systems and also by some network controllers, the inventory
   objects are most likely to be saved in different tables.  With the
   model defined in current draft, when doing a full synchronization,
   network controller needs to convert all inventory objects of each NE
   into component objects and combine them together into a single list,
   and then construct a response and send to OSS or MDSC.  The OSS or
   MDSC needs to classify the component list and divide them into
   different groups, in order to save them in different tables.  The
   combining-regrouping steps are impacting the network controller &
   OSS/MDSC processing, which may result in efficiency/scalability
   limitations in large scale networks.

   An alternative YANG model structure, which defines the inventory
   objects directly, instead of defining generic components, has also
   been analyzed.  However, also with this model, there still could be



Yu, et al.                Expires 21 July 2023                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft           Network Inventory YANG             January 2023


   some scalability limitations when synchronizing full inventory
   resources in large scale of networks.  This scalability limitation is
   caused by the limited transmission capabilities of HTTP protocol.  We
   think that this scalability limitation should be solved at protocol
   level rather than data model level.

   The model proposed by this draft is designed to be as generic as
   possible so to cover future special types of inventory objects that
   could be used in other technologies, that have not been identified
   yet.  If the inventory objects were to be defined directly with fixed
   hierarchical relationships in YANG model, this new type of inventory
   objects needs to be manually defined, which is not a backward
   compatible change and therefore is not an acceptable approach for
   implementation.  With a generic model, it is only needed to augment a
   new component class and extend some specific attributes for this new
   inventory component class, which is more flexible.  We consider that
   this generic data model, enabling a flexible and backward compatible
   approach for other technologies, represents the main scope of this
   draft.  Solution description to efficiency/scalability limitations
   mentioned above is considered as out-of-scope.

2.3.  Some Other Considerations

   Note: review in future versions of this document whether the
   component list should be under the network-inventory instead of the
   network-element container.

   Note that in [RFC8345], topology and inventory are two subsets of
   network information.  However, considering the complexity of the
   existing topology models and having a better extension capability, we
   define a separate root for the inventory model.  We will consider
   some other ways to do some associations between the topology model
   and inventory model in the future.

   Note: review in future versions of this document whether network
   hardware inventory should be defined as an augmentation of the
   network model defined in [RFC8345] instead of under a new network-
   inventory root.

   The proposed YANG data model has been analysed so far to cover the
   requirements and use cases for Optical Network Inventory.

   Further analysis of requirements and use cases is needed to extend
   the applicability of this YANG data model to other types of networks
   (IP and microwave) and to identify which aspects are generic and
   which aspects are technology-specific for optical.

A.1.  Comparison With Openconfig-platform Data Model

   Since more and more devices can be managed by domain controller
   through OpenConfig, to avoid that our inventory data model cannot
   cover these devices' inventory data, we have compared our inventory
   data model with the openconfig-platform.yang which is the data model
   used to manage inventory information in OpenConfig.

   Openconfig-platform data model is NE-level and uses a generic
   component concept to describe its inner devices and containers, which
   is similar to ietf-hardware model in [RFC8348].  Since we have also
   reused the component concept of [RFC8348] in our inventory data
   model, we can compare the component's attributes between openconfig-
   platform and our model directly , which is stated below:

      Table 2: Comparison between openconfig-platform and inventory
                                data model

   As it mentioned in Section 2.1.2 that state data and performance data
   are out of scope of our data model, it is same for alarm data and it
   should be defined in some other alarm data models separately.  And
   for some component specific structures in openconfig-platform, we
   consider some of them can be contained by our existing structure,
   such as fan, backplane, and controller-card.  And for some of them,
   there is no need to manage for operators, such as storage and cpu.

   Mostly, our inventory data model can cover the attributes from
   OpenConfig.
